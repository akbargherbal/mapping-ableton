automate_ableton_task.py

Builds on dump_ableton_pywinauto.py: instead of just reading the UIA tree,
this script *acts* on it, using the stable `automation_id` scheme Ableton
exposes under the Session View (discovered by inspecting a prior dump):

    SessionView.Track[N].Mixer.Arm                    CheckBox
    SessionView.Track[N].Mixer.Activator               CheckBox (mute)
    SessionView.Track[N].Mixer.Solo                     CheckBox
    SessionView.Track[N].Mixer.Monitoring.Buttons[0..2] RadioButton (In/Auto/Off)
    SessionView.Track[N].Mixer.Stop                     Button (clip stop)
    SessionView.Track[N].Slot[M]                        Group (clip slot)
    SessionView.ReturnTrack[N].Mixer.*                   same shape, return tracks
    Transport.Tempo                                     Slider
    Transport.Play / Transport.Stop

Using automation_id instead of visible `name` matters because names repeat
on every track ("In", "Auto", "Off", "Solo/Cue" all exist 4+ times) and are
locale-dependent, while these IDs are structural, per-track, and index-based.

Two hard-won lessons baked into this version (found by actually running it):

1. Ableton's Session View is UI-virtualized. A non-maximized/backgrounded
   window can expose ~60 automation_ids instead of ~201, missing controls
   entirely -- not a lookup bug, the element wasn't rendered yet. We
   maximize + focus the window before every run (see ensure_window_ready).

2. Cached control references go stale across state-changing actions.
   Holding a UIAWrapper captured before clicking Play, sleeping, then
   clicking Stop, and reusing that *same* reference afterward silently
   returned the wrong toggle state in testing -- one track was left
   soloed after a "restore" step that should have turned it off. The fix
   is to never hold a control across a gap; every click/read below
   re-resolves the control from a fresh, targeted tree walk immediately
   before touching it (see resolve()).

That trades some speed for correctness. For this scale of tree (~200
elements) a fresh walk is well under a second -- worth it for a script
that touches a live project.

Requirements
------------
- Windows 10/11, Ableton Live 12+ running with a project open
- pip install pywinauto
- dump_ableton_pywinauto.py in the same folder (we import find_ableton_window
  from it rather than re-implementing window discovery)

Usage
-----
    # Safe: prints the plan, clicks nothing
    python automate_ableton_task.py --task solo_tour --tracks 0 1 2 3

    # Actually perform it
    python automate_ableton_task.py --task solo_tour --tracks 0 1 2 3 --live

    # Arm track 1 for recording and set its monitor to "In"
    python automate_ableton_task.py --task arm_track --tracks 1 --live

    # Discover what track indices exist right now
    python automate_ableton_task.py --list-tracks

    # Diagnostics (always live-click regardless of --live -- see their
    # own docstrings for why)
    python automate_ableton_task.py --task probe_toggle --tracks 1
    python automate_ableton_task.py --task probe_solo_transport --tracks 1

    # Test click_by_id()'s L2 keyboard path directly (F1..F8
    # positional shortcut against Track[N].Activator, N=0..7 only)
    python automate_ableton_task.py --task probe_keyboard_activator --tracks 0

# WRITE-BACK STATUS BY CONTROL TYPE  (single source of truth -- read this
# before writing to ANY control; individual function docstrings below give
# context, this block is the authority)
#
#   CheckBox  -> PROVEN SAFE. set_checkbox_by_id() uses click + verify +
#                retry. This is the ONE proven reference implementation;
#                do not change its write mechanism.
#
#   Slider    -> SetValue() is CONFIRMED TO CRASH ABLETON LIVE ITSELF.
#                Calling RangeValuePattern.SetValue() / ValuePattern
#                .SetValue() on a Slider killed Ableton twice on
#                2026-08-08. Never call SetValue() on a live Slider.
#                The PROVEN-SAFE write path is double-click + type +
#                Enter via set_slider_by_id() (verified write: value is
#                read back after typing). DISABLED SetValue() / proven
#                click+type helper.
#
#   ComboBox   -> PROVEN SAFE via click-to-open + click-item
#                (set_combobox_by_id): opens the dropdown (ChooserPopUp)
#                and clicks the target MenuItem -- the same path a human
#                uses. ValuePattern.SetValue() / SelectionItemPattern are
#                NOT used (no confirmed crash, but no need to test a
#                pattern setter when click-item works). Verified write:
#                value is read back after the click.
#
# The disabled probe_write_back task and task_set_tempo's DANGER docstring
# preserve the historical record -- re-enabling any disabled SetValue()
# path is forbidden by this project's operating rules (see AGENTS.md).

# set_combobox_by_id) never cared what the automation_id was attached to
# -- Transport.Tempo and TrackView.Device[0].Freq are both just "a
# Slider" to set_slider_by_id. Before this section, the ONLY way to
# reach them was a fixed --task {arm_track, solo_one, ...} menu, which
# meant every new teaching moment turned into "write a new task_*
# function" instead of "call the existing generic primitive with a
# newly-looked-up id." See context.md §3 / PHASED_PLAN.md Phase 2.
#
# call_control() is the fix: given ANY automation_id (found live via
# --list-tracks, or offline via lookup_control() below), it reads the
# control's ACTUAL type straight off the resolved UIA element -- not a
# hardcoded per-id table, and not blind trust in a catalog snapshot that
# could be stale for e.g. a differently-loaded device -- and dispatches
# to whichever of the three proven-safe primitives matches. A control
# type outside that set (e.g. the 'Text'-type EQ Eight band selectors
# found during Phase 1 review) is refused with a clear error, never
# guessed at.

    read-vs-click question for Solo.

    Tests two currently-unverified things at once (see keyboard_shortcuts.py,

      1. Does F1..F8, sent via window.type_keys(), actually toggle Track

    Only accepts track_index 0..7 (see activator_shortcut_for_index() in
    keyboard_shortcuts.py) -- 8 keys exist, behavior beyond that is an open
    question, not something this probe guesses at.

    NOTE: like the other probe_* tasks, this always live-sends the

    idioms -- flip a switch (CheckBox toggle), turn a knob (Slider
    continuous value), pick from a list (ComboBox selection) -- using
    only automation_ids confirmed present in control_catalog.json,
    nothing guessed. (Write-back status per idiom: CheckBox = proven
    safe; Slider = proven safe via click+type (set_slider_by_id), NOT
    SetValue() which is confirmed to crash Ableton; ComboBox = proven
    safe via click-to-open + click-item (set_combobox_by_id), no
    pattern-based setter. All three are real writes with read-back
    verification -- see the WRITE-BACK STATUS note at the top of this
    module.)

    Idiom 1 -- Flip a switch (CheckBox):
        Transport.Metronome. Toggled on, briefly held, then restored to
        whatever it was before this ran. Safe against any project: it's a
        transport-level setting, not something tied to track content.

    Idiom 2 -- Turn a knob (Slider):
        TrackView.Device[0].Freq. Only present if the currently selected
        track's FIRST device is something exposing a "Freq" slider (EQ
        Eight's band 1, for example). This is now a REAL write: we change
        the value via double-click + type + Enter (set_slider_by_id), read
        it back to confirm the change actually landed, then restore the
        original value. Never RangeValuePattern.SetValue() -- that is
        confirmed to crash Ableton itself (see WRITE-BACK STATUS note). If
        no such device is loaded, this idiom is skipped with a clear
        message instead of failing the demo.

    Idiom 3 -- Pick from a list (ComboBox):
        Transport.GlobalQuantization. This is now a REAL write: the
        dropdown is opened by clicking the closed ComboBox and the target
        item is clicked (set_combobox_by_id) -- the same path a human
        uses, no pattern-based setter. The new selection is read back to
        confirm it landed, then restored to the original value.

    All three idioms are real, verified writes with restore -- this demo
    demonstrates exactly what the codebase can currently PROVE, no more.
