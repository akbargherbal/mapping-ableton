# build_runtime_env.sh — assemble the minimal, agent-facing runtime folder
# from this dev repo, so OpenCode never has filesystem access to the audit
# trail (context.md, docs/, tests, stale dumps, README).
#
# WHITELIST, not blacklist: only files listed in FILES[] below ever leave
# this repo. A new dev file added later is invisible to the agent unless
# someone deliberately adds it to the list — fails safe by default.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build_runtime_env.sh [target_dir]
#   target_dir defaults to a sibling folder: ../ableton-runtime
#
# Point OpenCode's working directory at <target_dir>, not this dev repo.
# Re-run this script any time AGENTS.md or the whitelisted scripts change;
# it's a straight overwrite of the code files, but never touches LABS/ or
# scripts/dumps/ once they exist, so prior session artifacts aren't lost.

# --- The whitelist -----------------------------------------------------
# Everything the agent needs to actually execute the routing rules, and
# nothing else. Dependency chain verified by grepping actual imports, not
# assumed from file names:
#   automate_ableton_task.py imports dump_ableton_pywinauto (window/tree
#     helpers) and keyboard_shortcuts (L2 escalation) — both hard deps.
#   dump_ableton_states.py imports both of the above too, if included.
#   orchestrate.sh calls automate_ableton_task.py and take_shot.sh by
#     relative path — both must sit exactly where it expects them.
#
# NOTE — dev-repo filename vs. runtime filename (session 7 fix):
# The routing/agent-instructions file is named `ABLETON_AGENT_POLICY.md`
# in THIS dev repo — deliberately NOT `AGENTS.md` — because `AGENTS.md`
# is a filename convention that agentic coding tools (OpenCode, Claude
# Code, etc.) treat as special: an assistant working *in this dev repo*
# (auditing/editing the project) would otherwise misread it as
# instructions directed at itself, when it's actually instructions for
# the Ableton-teaching agent under test. In the RUNTIME folder this
# script builds, it MUST be named `AGENTS.md` again — that convention is
# exactly what makes OpenCode auto-load it for the agent being tested.
# So this one entry has a source name different from its destination
# name; every other file keeps the same relative path on both sides.
