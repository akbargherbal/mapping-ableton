dump_ableton_states.py

Automates the manual loop of: switch Ableton to a given view, alt-tab back
to the terminal, run the dump script, repeat. Loops over one or more named
states in a single run and writes a labeled JSON dump for each, via the
same walk()/default_json_path() used by dump_ableton_pywinauto.py -- same
output format, same dumps/ folder, so nothing downstream needs to change.

Currently supported states
---------------------------
    session        Session View
    arrangement    Arrangement View
    sounds, instruments, drums, audio_effects, midi_effects, plugins
                   Browser panel categories (see note below -- less
                   verified than session/arrangement)

Browser panel categories: how selection works, and what's verified
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIRMED via grep_dump.py against a real dump: these DataItem tree
nodes carry an EMPTY automation_id ("Sounds" and "Instruments" both
checked directly). Unlike the Session View mixer controls, there's no
stable structural ID to click by here, so this falls back to matching on
(control_type, name) instead -- see find_control_by_name().

The real dump also showed the category label THREE levels deep with the
same name at each level (e.g. Library > Sounds > Sounds > Sounds, going
DataItem > DataItem > Text). find_control_by_name() matches depth-first
and returns on the first hit, so it lands on the OUTERMOST node --
almost certainly the real clickable list item, with the inner two being
its own label sub-elements. That's inferred, not proven: clicking the
outer DataItem hasn't actually been confirmed to change the selected
category yet.

All six categories (sounds, instruments, drums, audio_effects,
midi_effects, plugins) have been run via `--states all` and each
resulting dump shows a distinctly-named, distinctly-counted list marker
(e.g. "Sounds List, 1001 Items", "Instruments List, 23 Items", "Drums
List, 1001 Items", "Audio Effects List, 47 Items", "MIDI Effects List,
15 Items", "Plug-Ins List, 0 Items") -- confirming each category was
actually selected, not just re-labeled. See scripts/dumps/ for the dumps
this was verified against.

How Session/Arrangement switching works
------------------------------------------
Session View and Arrangement View share one window and toggle with Tab
(Live's default shortcut) -- no dedicated UIA button has been found for
it. Blindly pressing Tab would require already knowing the current view
to avoid toggling the wrong way -- the exact kind of unverified-state
assumption that caused the stuck-soloed-track bug in
automate_ableton_task.py. Instead we detect the current view first:
Session View's tree exposes SessionView.* automation_ids only while it's
actually rendered on screen (same UI-virtualization behavior documented
in dump_ableton_pywinauto.py) -- Arrangement View doesn't. So "are we in
Session View" reduces to "does a fresh index contain any SessionView.*
id", a check we get for free from behavior already characterized.
**CONFIRMED WORKING** -- user ran this against the real app; log showed
the Tab press landing and the resulting dumps had genuinely different
content (Session dump has a "Session" group with Track Headers/Slots/
Scenes; Arrangement dump has an "Arrangement" group with Timeline/
Loop Brace).

Requirements
------------
- dump_ableton_pywinauto.py and automate_ableton_task.py in the same
  folder (imports find_ableton_window/ensure_window_ready/walk/
  print_tree/default_json_path from the former, build_automation_id_index
  from the latter -- no logic duplicated here).

Usage
-----
    python dump_ableton_states.py --states session arrangement
    python dump_ableton_states.py --states session --label-suffix before-edit
    python dump_ableton_states.py --states sounds instruments
    python dump_ableton_states.py --states all   # every known state, one command
    python dump_ableton_states.py --states all --label-suffix before-edit
