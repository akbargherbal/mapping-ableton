#!/usr/bin/env bash
# build_mastering_env.sh — assemble a self-contained runtime folder for the
# "Mastering Suno AI Music in Ableton" course.
#
# SCOPE: the learner is a total DAW novice, not just a mastering novice —
# never used a DAW, no music theory, has never touched Ableton. This runtime
# is a hybrid:
#
#   INCLUDED  -- the click-demonstration primitives (automate_ableton_task.py
#                + its hard deps), the control_catalog.json ground-truth
#                reference (consulted on-demand/narrowly by scripts, never
#                bulk-loaded into the agent's own context), and take_shot.sh
#                for ad hoc screenshot capture.
#   EXCLUDED  -- orchestrate.sh (belongs to the sibling click-automation
#                course; this course's tutoring is live/conversational, not
#                a pre-scripted task list).
#
# WHITELIST, not blacklist: only files listed in FILES[] below ever leave
# this repo.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build_mastering_env.sh [target_dir]
#   target_dir defaults to a sibling folder: ../suno-mastering-course
#
# Point OpenCode's working directory at <target_dir> for the mastering
# course. Re-run any time SUNO_MASTERING_AGENT_POLICY.md or the whitelisted
# docs/scripts change — straight overwrite of those, but KNOWN_ISSUES.md in
# the target is never touched once it exists (it's a live session artifact
# the agent appends to, not a build output), and LABS/ / scripts/dumps/ raw
# dump files are preserved if pre-existing.
